                description: 'One of the main reasons why we started Best Electronics 40+ years ago, we saw a need for a company to supply Atari end users and even Atari Dealers with much needed Atari replacement parts.  Atari had their Nation wide Atari run Service Centers and their Atari authorized individual Dealer network all over the US who would service Atari products with the stock replacement Atari parts the would bring into the US.  But Atari USA would not bring in certain Atari replacement parts to fix product problems that it seems all Atari users knew about, but no other companies that sold or supported Atari products wanted to tackle.  So Best Electronics found it is niche in the Atari world back then.Best Electronics bought thousands and thousands of pallets of Atari goods out of the local Sunnyvale Atari warehouses over a 10 to 15 year period.  In theory we could run our Atari company for 15 to 30+ years on what we bought from Atari, take the easy way and only sell on E-Bay / Internet and never have to spend any more money on any new Atari Inventory.  But at Best, we strongly believe in Atari Customer Service / Support and helping our Atari customers with there Atari product problems.  We are always trying to do improvements on existing Atari products and bring in new Atari goods and upgraded Atari replacement parts for Atari users when we can.  We have seen over the years in the Atari Business other Atari companies who only tried to live off their Atari Inventory and never spend any money on new Atari Products and Inventory go the way of the Dinosaur.  Over the last 40+ years in the Atari business, Best Electronics has invested close to $100,000+ in Engineering Development costs, New tooling costs including New plastic molds, Silk Screens, test fixtures and new production processes (one time charge), to produce our Exclusive Best New Atari products, replacement parts, Atari upgrade parts and Atari product upgrades.  For a large company that amount of development costs is a drop in the bucket as far as developing new products.  For a small Atari company like Best, in a lot of cases it was a leap of faith and a long time investment in the Atari market place to invest that amount of company funds in new Atari replacement parts.  Most of the company funds we have invested in new Atari replacement and Atari upgrade products have paid off (covered all of the up front Development costs, tooling investments).  But some new Atari part sales have taken 8 to 12+ years before Best has even broke even on a new Atari replacement part or upgrade, a long time investment for us.  A very few rare cases, we will never even pay off, the development costs, new tool costs, shipping in costs on some new Atari replacement parts we have produced.  But for Best Electronics, the fact we provided Atari world wide users an impossible to find new Atari replacement part (even at a loss) that prevented that Atari user from scraping out the Atari product is very important to us.',
