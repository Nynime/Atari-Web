                <label for="set-1-question-1" class="faq--question">Q. Are the Atari items on your Web site really really in stock?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. Yes, I would say that 98 to 99% of the Atari items listed at our Best Web site are in stock.  Occasionally we sell out of an Atari item (1 out of 5,000+ Atari items in stock) and just forget to update the Best Web site for that one Atari item.  I understand why people ask this question.  Many people have found new internet Atari web sites that list Atari items that are not in stock or only have one of that item that quickly sell out!</span>

                <label for="set-1-question-2" class="faq--question">Q. Are the Atari items listed on your Web Site really New and how can that be some 38 years latter?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. Unless other wise stated (reconditioned, used or loose), all Atari items on our web site are New.  As we cleared out the 4 to 6 different Atari warehouses over the past 20 years in Sunnyvale California, we bought thousands of pallets of new Atari Products, OEM Atari replacement parts, Atari Accessories, Atari Collector items, Atari Corporate Headquarters items like Prototype Atari products, Atari Engineering items and now have them in our different Atari warehouses.  Many Atari items we have in stock we have a lifetime supply of and some more popular Atari items we do sell out of (see Catalog Addendum) and they disappear into Atari history.</span>

                <span class="faq--answer">A. Yes a good percentage of our Atari business over the last 40+ years has come from Atari Customer Referrals / Recommendations from past Happy customers and yes all of the Atari items they say we have in stock are really in stock!   According to our busy Atari Accounting department, our four oldest active Best Atari Customer account numbers are BT00149, BT00179, BT00294 and BT00295 that have been buying from Best Electronics for their Atari items / needs for close to 29 to 32+ years now!</span>

                <label for="set-2-question-1" class="faq--question">Q. Do you ship Atari orders to International Countries?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. Best Electronics has been shipping Atari orders all over the world for over 30+ years now.</span>

                <label for="set-2-question-2" class="faq--question">Q. After I place my Atari order, how long before my Atari order is shipped to me, and how long will it take to get to me?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer" class="faq--question">A. 98 - 99% of the Atari orders we take, are shipped the Next working day typically.  Domestically we ship Priority Mail (2 - 3 three working days) or Surface Mail (5 - 8 working days).  International orders delivery times vary by Country, Shipping method and Local Customs processing time.</span>

                <input id="set-2-question-3" type="checkbox" class="visually-hidden" />
                <label for="set-2-question-3" class="faq--question">Q. Why do you not just Flat rate your shipping charges like other Atari Dealers on the internet do?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. That would mean in 50% of the cases you are over paying for your shipping charges and subsidizing somebody else's Atari shipping charges.   Some Internet companies add extra charges (Handling charge) to the your shipping costs, so the total freight charges you pay, become a profit item / center for them.  We only charge you what the United States Postal System charges us to get your order to you.</span>

              <li class="faq--item">
                <input id="set-2-question-4" type="checkbox" class="visually-hidden" />
                <label for="set-2-question-4" class="faq--question">Q. I would like to Place a Mail order but I do not know what the shipping charge is to my location in the US.</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. We do have a  Min. normal Atari order of $20 plus shipping and a Min. Prepaid (Mail Order) order of $15 plus shipping.  With over 5000+ Atari Items and Replacement Parts in stock and every Atari owner orders slightly different Atari items from us, almost no two Atari orders in a row we have shipped in the last 38 years will weigh exactly the same.  It is best to contact us (E-Mail or Phone) with the Atari items you want and your ship to address (Zip code / or International location), so we can give you a shipping quotation.  If already know the approximate Weight of your Domestic Atari order, then just go the USPS Web site and look up the Priority Mail charge from our 95112 Zip code to your Zip code. </span>

              <span class="faq--answer">A. In about 98 - 99% of the Atari orders we have taken and shipped in the last 38 years are shipped the next working day, we bill your Credit Card the day your order is shipped only.</span>

              <span class="faq--answer">A. Unlike other Atari Dealers on the internet, we ship all Atari Mail orders within one to three working days after they arrive here. </span>

                <label for="set-3-question-4" class="faq--question">Q. "Do you Maintain a list of Credit Card numbers on file?"</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. For Security reasons, we do not Maintain a list of our customers Credit Card account numbers for more than a few weeks.  So If you have not ordered from us in a few months, you will have to give your Credit Card details again.  For steady Best customers who place orders with Best on a regular basis, with their permission, we do retain Credit Card information.</span>

                <label for="set-3-question-5" class="faq--question">Q. I have only used PayPal to pay for auctions in the past. How do I pay for my non auction related Atari order?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. For Domestic Atari orders, we have stopped accepting PayPal payments.  We have now switched to Google Pay payment method.</span>
            </li>
            <li class="faq--item">
                <input id="set-3-question-6" type="checkbox" class="visually-hidden" />
                <label for="set-3-question-6" class="faq--question">Q. I see you now accept Google Pay Payments for Atari orders. Since you do not have a On Line order form and shopping cart at the Best Web Site, how do I pay for an Atari order via Google Pay payment system?</label>
                <span class="faq--answer">A. Since we have over 5,000+ Atari items in stock, no two Atari orders we ship have the same exact Atari items or shipping charge for orders we ship all over the United States and World.  This is one of the main reasons why we do not have an On Line order and check out form at the Best Web site.  For Google Atari orders you want to place, we advice you to E-Mail us and tell us the Atari items and Quantities you want, your Google Confirmed ship to address.  We will E-Mail you back a complete cost break down for your Google Atari order with shipping charges and also send a Google Pay E-Mail payment request with the same break down of costs for your Atari order.</span>

              <span class="faq--answer">A. Yes we have been helping Atari owner's fix their Atari products for 40+ years now. To properly help you fix / repair your Atari product, the more information you an give us (E-Mail or Call in) about your Atari product problems, the better the chances we can help you Diagnose and fix your Atari problem the first time. </span>

                <span class="faq--answer">A. Over the last 15 of 38 years in the Atari business, we have worked a split day,  Afternoon office hours (for E-Mail and phone calls) and nights (sometimes all night) to pack and invoice Atari orders.   Using this split method of work, we found that we can keep up with the volume of Atari orders we receive each day and also turn your Atari orders around within 24 hours or less!  One of the standard comments we get back from our New first time Atari customers, we were amazed / impressed how fast we got our Atari order from you.   Hint:  If you E-Mail us during our normal afternoon office hours below (M - F), you will be impressed with how fast we reply back to you.  Yes we do also answer your Atari E-Mails on Weekends too (E-Mails down loaded and answered at least once a day on weekends). </span>

              <span class="faq--answer">A. Correct, Many of our Best Web site pages do not get updated very often.  Unlike others Atari companies on the Internet with limited Stock levels (sometimes as low as one or two Atari items in stock per their web listings), Best has over 5,000+ Atari items in stock, in two different warehouses.  So we do update the Best Web pages (and The Best Catalog Addendum) when we Sell out of an Atari item, about ready to sell out of an item (price increase) for ever or get a new Atari item in only.</span>
